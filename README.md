# Nest Movies API

A simple movies API built with NestJS for study purposes. It serves movies with genres and staff, persisting data using MySQL.


## Installation
To install this API and run it on your own computer, you'll need NodeJS and NPM installed beforehand.

Then, open the folder containing this code and run on terminal:

```
$ npm i
```

After installing all dependencies, you must point the API to a database, preferrably MySQL, but you can use other SQL databases too.

Copy the file `.env.example` to a new `.env`.
- Tip: You can do so using the terminal: 
```
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, fill in the spaces left with your credentials as below:

```
DATABASE_URL= "mysql://user:password@serverAdress:port/db_name"
```

If you're using PostgreSQL, change the protocol from `mysql://` to `postgresql://`. If you do so, remember to change it too on `./prisma/schema.prisma`

When you're done setting up the `.env` file, run: 

```
npx prisma migration dev --name init
```

This will make Prisma create the tables and relationships on your database while also creating the Prisma Client and all the methods necessary to CRUD endpoints.

## Running the app
